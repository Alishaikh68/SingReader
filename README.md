# SingReader
Virtual Sign Language Translator ‚Äì Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe - Built real-time ASL and ISL gesture recognition tool - Integrated webcam feed with gesture detection and live translation

Sign Language Detection using AI
SignReader uses cutting-edge AI technology to detect and interpret sign language in real-time. Our system precisely predicts hand gestures and translates them into text, making communication seamless and accessible for everyone.

Combining deep learning models and advanced image processing, we empower the community by breaking barriers between the hearing and non-hearing world. Our mission is to provide an intuitive, fast, and reliable tool for sign language recognition, fostering inclusive communication.

Join us in transforming how we communicate through technology. Together, we can create a more connected and inclusive world.

How It Works

Step 1: Real-Time Video Capture
Our system starts by capturing real-time video using your webcam. It analyzes the gestures using cutting-edge computer vision techniques to understand sign language movements.

Step 2: Hand Landmark Detection
Using MediaPipe, we detect key landmarks of the hand, such as fingers, wrist, and palm. This data helps in understanding the position and movement of your hands during communication.

Step 3: Real-Time Prediction
The captured data is processed by a machine learning model, which makes real-time predictions to determine the sign language gesture being made, displaying the corresponding character or word.

Step 4: User Feedback
Once a sign language gesture is detected, the predicted word or character is displayed on the screen, providing immediate feedback to the user in an interactive way!
